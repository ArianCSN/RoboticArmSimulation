# **Robotic Arm Simulation Project**

## **Overview**
This MATLAB project implements a simple robotic arm simulation using the built-in Robotics System Toolbox. The robotic arm consists of multiple rigid bodies connected by joints.
The provided main_simulation.m script sets up the robot and displays it in 3D.

## **Prerequisites**
MATLAB (with Robotics System Toolbox installed)
Getting Started
Clone the Repository:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project folder.
Run the Simulation:
Open MATLAB.
Change the current directory to the project folder.
Run the main_simulation.m script.
The 3D visualization of the robotic arm will appear.
Customization:
Modify the parameters (mass, inertia, joint limits, etc.) directly in the main_simulation.m script to customize the robotâ€™s properties.
Adjust joint angles or other parameters to observe different arm configurations.
