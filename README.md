# Robotic Arm Simulation Project

## Overview

This MATLAB project implements a simple robotic arm simulation. The robotic arm consists of multiple rigid bodies connected by joints, allowing it to move in various configurations. The provided `main_simulation.m` script sets up the robot and displays it in 3D.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine.
   - Navigate to the project folder.

2. **Run the Simulation:**
   - Open MATLAB.
   - Change the current directory to the project folder.
   - Run the `main_simulation.m` script.
   - The 3D visualization of the robotic arm will appear.

3. **Customization:**
   - Modify the parameters (mass, inertia, joint limits, etc.) directly in the `main_simulation.m` script to customize the robot's properties.
   - Adjust joint angles or other parameters to observe different arm configurations.
